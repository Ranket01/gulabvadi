Dietary fiber is essential for maintaining a healthy digestive system and can help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Kesar mangoes also contain small amounts of other nutrients, such as potassium, calcium, and iron.

            Kesar mangoes are ready to eat when they are fully ripe, which can be determined by their color and texture. A ripe Kesar mango will have a golden-yellow skin with a reddish blush on the top. The fruit will be slightly soft to the touch and will give slightly when pressed gently. The aroma of a ripe Kesar mango will be sweet and fragrant, with a hint of tropical fruit. It is important not to judge the ripeness of a mango by its color alone, as this can be misleading. Instead, use your sense of touch and smell to determine if the mango is ready to eat.

            Kesar mangoes should be stored at room temperature until they are ripe, at which point they can be stored in the refrigerator for up to five days. It is important to store the mangoes in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, as this can cause them to spoil or ripen too quickly. If you have a large number of mangoes, you can also store them in the freezer for later use. To do this, peel and slice the mangoes and place them in a freezer-safe container or bag. They can be stored in the freezer for up to six months.
